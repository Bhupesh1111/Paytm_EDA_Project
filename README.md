 Yes_bank_EDA_Project
Yes Bank is a well-known financial institution in the Indian domain. Since 2018, it has consistently made headlines due to fluctuations in its stock prices attributed to events involving the company's founder, Rana Kapoor. Given this context, there is a significant interest in assessing how such occurrences impact the bank's stock prices and whether predictive models, including time series methods, can effectively address such situations.

The dataset at hand encompasses monthly stock price records of Yes Bank since its inception. It covers a range of metrics, including monthly closing, opening, highest, and lowest stock prices. The primary aim of this project is to construct models capable of predicting the closing price of the bank's stock for a given month.

#This project carries a pivotal significance, as accurately predicting Yes Bank's stock prices is a crucial task for a multitude of stakeholders, investors, and market participants. Yes Bank's prominence in the private sector banking industry in India has been coupled with challenges like high levels of non-performing assets and involvement in fraudulent activities. These challenges have prompted regulatory intervention by the Reserve Bank of India, rendering the prediction of Yes Bank's stock prices intricate and uncertain.
